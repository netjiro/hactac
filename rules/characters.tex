Here are some example Hero characters. First a few newbie wannabecome heroes rolled up by the author, then some examples of player built Heroes rolled up for the \texttt{Return of Uchly Namen} campaign, then some more experienced heroes.

\

Since the xp cost of various skills are constantly tweaked, all of the characters listed below are probably not up to date at any given time. I don't intend to ever hard lock down the xp costs since it's more fun to adapt to make the game more interesting and never have "the one best way" for any given adventure or campaign.

\noindent Lars LongShot used to hunt rabbits and deer, now he mostly hunts beer, fame, and gold.
When he saves up some more money he can switch up to a heavy longbow since he has very high strength, and consider a smaller staff for fast 2ap defence. Alternatively burn 18xp on agile to meet the dex requirements to get the large staff fast and 4xp on quick to get 4ap base, giving 2x fast defence actions without mods and 3x with mod-2. Very useful when things get hectic and the bugs are swarming in.

\noindent Newton spent his whole childhood fighting imaginary monsters with his overly large and heavy wooden sword, whittled by his uncle Marrowood. On his 18th birthday he packed a light knapsack and broke his piggy bank. Then said goodbye to his father and mother, kissed his girlfriend goodbye, and went out into the world looking for monsters to slay. First stop was the smithy, where he spent almost all his considerable savings on a brand new heroic 2h sword.

Without armour and only the sword for defence he's quite vulnerable, but perhaps 20hp makes up for it?

\section*{Experienced Heroes}
%----------------------------
In practice, so far, we've tested hundreds of hours of game time with dozens of characters ranging around 100-1000xp. We haven't had any super high level adventures yet, so we haven't really tested 1000xp+ Heroes. The game scales very well up to 1k, and probably a bit beyond. We just don't have the data.


\subsection*{Tråk-Ture}
%----------------------
Tråk-Ture is a very typical, uninspired, example Hero at 250xp. Intended to show new players how to build a simple character for the \texttt{07 Eviction} adventure. Though the base roll for the character was unusually good, with high str, dex, hp, stamina, movement, vision, ap.

There is nothing wrong with Typical Heroes, but it can be more fun to build gubbins that have some non standard aspects and opportunities. For first time players it's easier to get a quick feel for the game with a standard Hero which is simpler to play reasonably well.
