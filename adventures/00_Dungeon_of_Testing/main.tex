\section*{Dungeon of Testing}

This tiny dungeon adventure is meant to be the first introduction to the game that a new player has with their first character, before taking on the real dangers out there. It is meant to be a solo experience, just the player and the gm, so as to get a good one on one introduction experience. And it's an excellent opportunity to work out the kinks in the player's first, freshly built, newbie Hero.

The monsters in the Dungeon of Testing will not kill a character, which is nice for a first experience. These are test monsters, not like \emph{real} monsters. The peculiar magic of self reflection and re-evaluation that accompanies the Dungeon of Testing is also very good for characters that want to change how they have spent their XP growing up, once they have found some glaring holes in their survival capacity.

A Dungeon of Testing is something most serious towns have, on franchise from Ottokar's Test Dungeons. It will scare some young fools into staying in the village to become farmers or blacksmiths instead of travelling the world as dragon slayers or explore the limited career options of compost. 
%\emph{Compost: most common retirement path of ex-adventurers.}

The idea of the Dungeon of Testing is to be slightly too difficult for most new characters so that the player can re-evaluate how the XP are spent before the character goes into real combat in adventures and campaigns.




\subsection*{Introduction}

The Dungeon of Testing is small and with only a few critters. It takes about an hour to play through. It is a bit too hard for most newbie 100xp adventurers, but that is the idea. Enter the dungeon, kill the runt before he alerts the goblins. Fight the goblins to get their stuff, or lure them out and steal it. Hope they don't wake the orc. Fight the orc if you're unlucky. Make it out alive with gold and XP.

\begin{readoutloud}
Welcome young [insert name here]. This is the Dungeon of Testing, designed by Ottokar's Test Dungeons. The monsters here will not really kill you, not for real, unless by accident. They are also very well trained to feign death once their hp reaches 0, so please don't overkill them just to be sure. They will not stand up and attack you in the back once they have accepted "death".

When you have made it out alive, or been carried out as a near dead loser, you will be given the magical ability to change how you have spent your youthful XP growing up.

There is a weak lantern you may borrow if you so wish, but we do advise that you purchase some decent spelunking equipment before setting out on your adventures: A light source, fire tools, rope, grappling hook, water skin, some rations, loot bags, etc, will always come in handy sooner or later.

Any coins you find you will be allowed to keep, as a starting grant for your newly chosen career path. Weaponry and items you find have to be returned when you leave.

So, off you go. Good Luck and all that.
\end{readoutloud}

\noindent
If the wannabe Hero leaves on foot he can keep any coin found and XP earned. If he has to be carried out on a stretcher and resurrected they will take the coin but he'll keep the XP as a lesson to caution. It's good to know when to flee.

\subsection*{Dungeon mechanics}

This is an exceptionally simple dungeon. There is a simple weak magic trap, then just the monsters. The dungeon is dark, except for the lanterns in the goblins' room. Remember that carrying a moving light source will make the Hero \emph{very} visible.

The weak lantern can be picked up and carried around, occupying a hand of course. The big brazier can be pushed 1sq/r, and the regular strength lanterns can be picked up from the wall hangers and carried. Lantern or torches can be placed on the ground to light an area. These training monsters will not destroy the lanterns to gain advantage by darkness. Note that this is a dangerous thing to do under \emph{real} adventuring conditions.

Start the Hero by the Heroes' Standard, beside the weak lantern.


\subsection*{The trap}

The large floor sigil in the central room is built to simulate a "very old" magic trap. Anything touching the central square triggers a chock doing 1 dam penetrating and 9 stun, as blue-white jagged arcs shoot up from the floor. The adjacent squares trigger small sparks in the sigil, simulating old failing magic. All the monsters avoid the central 9 squares in the sigil. It will wake the runt but is not loud enough for anything else. The trap recharges in 10r.


\subsection*{Cave rooms}

The cave is suitably dark and dank. No light except from the four lanterns in the goblins' room. Some walls are natural, but most have been widened by hand. All is old and much worn. It smells of svartfolk, old blood, and crushed dreams.

\

\textbf{The central room} is wide and open with a large old worn sigil at the center. The trap is the central nine squares of the sigil. All five tunnels look more or less the same, but there comes a very faint soft glow from the tunnel leading to the goblins' room.

\

\textbf{The altar rooms} are both the same. The altars can be opened with a traps \& locks mod+3 or a str mod-3 roll. They both contain an old sacrificial dagger each, but nothing of value. Beside the altars are small braziers where the Hero can light fires if he want some light. They shine like torches and some of the light will illuminate the central room.

\

\textbf{The goblins' room} is warm and cozy compared to the rest of the cave, but it reeks of goblins. The Heroes can smell the goblins already from the tunnel at perception mod+3. Four lit lanterns hang from the walls. A shelf, a weapons rack, and a pile of boxes stand against the walls. The shelf has a map of the dungeon with the trap and the orc marked, find mod=0. The weapons rack has goblin spears, clubs, shields, bows, and arrows. The boxes have some coin and a treasure map.

\

\textbf{The orc's room} is mostly a sandy beach against an underground stream. The Hero can hear the water running from the tunnel on perception mod=0, and the orc snore mod-3. They can also smell the orc mod=0.



\subsection*{The opposition}

One runt in the central room, two goblin fighters with clubs and two with bows, two goblin warriors, and one orc asleep in the far room.

The opposition is meant to be a little too difficult for most newbie 100xp adventurers. The experience will hopefully demonstrate the Hero's shortcomings, so the player can modify the skill set.

If you believe the monsters are too easy, then add another goblin fighter or two with clubs or bows, or change one or two fighter into warriors. In drastic cases add another orc.

More scholarly characters, intended for support roles, will usually be far outclassed. Remove some of the goblin opposition, but keep one archer and the orc. A charging orc is useful for scaring the newbie out of the dungeon. Give the noob an extra round of screaming orc approaching to get the hint.

\

\textbf{The runt knifer} is almost asleep and has mod-3 to perception. Remember to modify accordingly if the Hero is sneaking, wearing armour, carrying the lantern, or enter back-lit. The runt's job is to sound the alarm so the other goblins hear it, not to wake the orc. If he sees someone enter he will snap to, then take action next round. He can scream to signal the goblins, or sneak north and tell them if the Hero has not noticed him. The runt is snoozing crawled up along a wall crevice, his half snores can be heard at mod=0 when entering the rooms.
The runt will try to flee instead of fight. He will first flee towards the goblins. If they start falling fast he will try to flee to wake the orc.

\

\textbf{The goblins} will react to the runt scream the next round. They will go grab their weapons and start walking down to investigate. Otherwise they are sitting talking and playing dice, perception mod-3. Their weapons are stowed in the rack, taking 1r to pick up.

They will put up a decent fight when engaged, but will flee once they get too hurt or have lost half their people. Both they and the runt will flee to the orc if possible at this point.
Goblins are cautious and cowardly when fighting. They will try to take advantage of their numbers and surround the aspiring adventurer, or run and kite.

\

\textbf{The orc} is asleep, and has a 20\% chance of waking each round if there is fighting going on in the main room. He will then take one round to wake up, another to get his club, then start walking to join the fray. If he hears death screams from the goblins he will start to run. Any fleeing goblins will wake him and he will run to attack the intruders. 

The orc is a bold fighter and will not start parrying attacks until he is below half hp. He will instead usually push the advantage, charge if possible, and continue attacking as response to incoming attacks.
When the orc has engaged the Hero the goblins left standing will be sure of victory once again and return to fight offensively.


\subsection*{The Loot}

The goblin boxes have 5+1d5 silver and a treasure map. The map leads to the adventure job announcement board in Trade Town. The goblin runt has 1d3 copper, the goblins 1d10c, the orc 2d10c.\\
\begin{samepage} \small \begin{verbatim}
XP for the dungeon:
    each room explored                                                     1xp
    getting out alive, after loosing >50%hp or winning                     5xp
XP for opposition:
    runt 1xp, fighter 1xp, warrior 2xp, orc 3xp                           10xp
\end{verbatim} \end{samepage} \normalsize


\subsection*{Playthroughs}

The Dungeon of Testing has been played by every new player so far as an introduction to the game and the tools. Two characters have made it through with both loot and xp, but most flee with barely an hp left to their name, then change a bit in their skill lists.

It usually takes about an hour to run through the dungeon, while explaining the rules and having the player get used to maptool.
